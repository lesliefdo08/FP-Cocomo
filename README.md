# FP-Cocomo
This project implements Function Point Analysis (FPA) and Basic COCOMO to estimate the size, effort, and development time of a software system. FPA is used to calculate the functional size based on user interactions and data files, while Basic COCOMO converts the estimated size into person-months and schedule predictions.
