**Function Point Analysis & Basic COCOMO**

**Project Overview**

This project demonstrates two widely used software estimation techniques:

Function Point Analysis (FPA) – for measuring the functional size of a software system based on inputs, outputs, files, and inquiries.

Basic COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model) – for estimating the effort, development time, and staffing needs based on the project size in KLOC (thousand lines of code).

Together, these methods provide a structured way to estimate software size, effort, cost, and productivity.

**Function Point Analysis**
Function Types & Complexity Weights
Function Type	Simple	Average	Complex
External Inputs (EI)	3	4	6
External Outputs (EO)	4	5	7
External Inquiries (EQ)	3	4	6
Internal Logical Files (ILF)	7	10	15
External Interface Files (EIF)	5	7	10
Steps Performed

Identified the count of function types.

Multiplied counts with complexity weights → Unadjusted Function Points (UFP).

Applied Value Adjustment Factor (VAF) → Adjusted Function Points (AFP).

Converted FP to estimated Lines of Code (LOC) (based on programming language).

**Basic COCOMO**
COCOMO Categories

Organic: Small, simple projects with small teams.

Semi-Detached: Intermediate-size projects with mixed experience levels.

Embedded: Large, complex projects with tight constraints.

**How to Use**

Use the FPA method to calculate Function Points (FP).

Convert FP into KLOC depending on the programming language.

Apply the Basic COCOMO equations to estimate effort and development time.

Use the results for project planning, staffing, and cost estimation.

**Applications**

Early-stage software project estimation

Effort, cost, and schedule prediction
